Focused Casting. Taking damage can't break the sidekick's concentration on a
spell.
Powerful Build. The goliath counts as one size larger when determining its
carrying capacity and the weight it can push, drag, or lift.
Spellcasting. The Sidekick is a 20th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability
is Wisdom (spell save DC 19, +11 to hit with spell attacks). The Sidekick has
the following Cleric spells prepared:

Cantrips (at will): mending, resistance, spare the dying, toll the dead
1st level (4/4 slots): cure wounds, healing word, sanctuary
2nd level (3/3 slots): aid, lesser restoration, spiritual weapon
3rd level (3/3 slots): reviviify, spirit guardians
4th level (3/3 slots): death ward
5th level (2/2 slots): greater restoration, mass cure wounds

ACTIONS
Spear. Melee Weapon Attack: ++10 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one
target. Hit: (1d6++4) piercing damage, (1d8++4) piercing damage. if used with
two hands to make a melee attack

REACTIONS
Stone's Endurance (Recharges after a long or short rest). The goliath can focus
itself to occasionally shrug off injury. When it takes damage, it can use its
reaction to roll a d12. Add its Constitution modifier to the number rolled, and
reduce the damage by that total.
